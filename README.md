Trunic Translator by Avery More

Simple Python app made for translating the fictional language
used in the game "Tunic". Uses Tkinter for the UI.

TODO:

- Add the remaining rune translations
- Add the little circle used for reversing the inner and outer runes
- Add more text editing options (forward/back, clear, backspace)
- Add a read-aloud text to speech button
- Display previously inputted runes?
- Add support for an IPA translation?
